You have never read an article by the apptimists because this is actually the first one. But like I started programming around the millenium I'll give it a try. Hopefully I'll learn nice techniques or find some writing frameworks to share some of our thoughts in a manner that you are not bored after the first sentence.

If you've never heard of the apptimists we specialized in building small applications mostly in the fields of location-based services, advocating startups in the region of Saarland and contributing to some open-source projects like souyuz. We are a pretty small team of nerds and the creators of StauMobil. The free app for iOS and Android shows traffic incidents like congestions, constructions and road closures in Germany and is being downloaded 4 million times in the end of 2017.

This is the first article of an undetermined number of writings about the unfiltered, uncensored and unsparing time at the apptimists, in short: we are going to share our journey for the almost last 7 years. So fasten your seatbelt, lean back and enjoy!

## Episode 1: The beginning

It all started in 2011 when Andreas (short: Andy), Dominik (short: Domme) and I studied Computer Science at the Saarland University.
To give a short historical background. These are five facts from that year:
- Apple released the iPhone 4s
- CERN scientists found neutrinos which are 60 nanoseconds quicker than light
- Microsoft launched its cloud-based service Office 365
- You got some Ice Cream Sandwich with Google's Android 4.0
- The world population reached 7 billion inhabitants

Like all students we loved to party so we came up with that idea to aggregate all party event information on the web we could find put them in a database, enrich them with some data mining, geolocate them and provide a neatly list of parties all over the country within an app for iOS and Android. Sounds tough? It was!

So what we did here was heavily using the Facebook's newly introduces Open Graph. The users created an



Alright folks, that's enough for today. Hope you enjoyed reading the first episode, the others will follow. Would be pleasure to have a chat with you, so feel free to contact us!
